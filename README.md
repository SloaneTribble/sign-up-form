# sign-up-form

This set of programs is based on an assignment from The Odin Project.  My goal in completing this assignment is/was to practice 
some intermediate HTML and CSS concepts.  

For HTML, form validation is one of the most important concepts at play.

As for CSS, the use of pseudo elements and pseudo classes, custom properties, positioning (absolute, fixed etc.)
and resizing (min, max, clamp) are novel techniques which are gratefully being brought into practice.
